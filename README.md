Final Project for Drawing on the Web Course



## Thought Process 

My favorite story growing up was Alice in Wonderland. I really like the idea of changing something about ordinary household objects to make them absurd or fantastical. I wanted to create a whimsical experience by using a single pattern or texture for each object in a scene that is set in a room with simple household objects. To add a bit of drama to the scene, I added a moving floor plane. 


## Text and Protype

For each drawing, I plan to use Three.js geometry to create a room with a gooey floor plane (using the same concepts as in the creation of a terrain object). I let the user pick the pattern or texture to use for each surface of the drawing. I plan to build a few household objects in Blender, such as a household plant, chairs and a table. I’m rendering the three.js drawing on a canvas element that I’m using as a card. When the user clicks to change a pattern, I will animate the canvas card to flip on the y axis to its backside, where a drawing with the selected pattern will be. The floor plane, and the moving objects are performative. The interactivity of the scene comes in with the ability to choose a pattern.
